/*
  SD card test 
   
 This example shows how use the utility libraries on which the'
 SD library is based in order to get info about your SD card.
 Very useful for testing a card when you're not sure whether its working or not.
 	
 The circuit:
  * SD card attached to SPI bus as follows:
	Refer to "libraries/SdFat/Sd2Card_config.h"
