This was part of a project for a "dream study".
The device was battery powered so the patient could stay at home in his normal environment.
The data sampled could be written on sd-card or transfered via bluetooth.

Sensors included:
- 3-axis leg sensors
- ecg
- 8-channel eeg
- emg
- eog
- 3-axis accelerometer for general movement
